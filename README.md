CRNA ToDo Example project
=========================

I'm making this simple ToDo app as an introduction to React Native and Javascript development for mobile devices.
Feel free to clone the project. To run it, you must have Expo app installed on your device and CRNA in your computer.
Once done, just __yarn start__ in the main directory and scan the QR code with your phone.
